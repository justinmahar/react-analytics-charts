## Installation

```
npm i react-analytics-charts
```

## Quick Start

First, you will need an [OAuth Client ID](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/google-oauth-client-id) from Google to access the Analytics API. See [How To Get An OAuth Client ID From Google](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/google-oauth-client-id) to make this as easy and painless as possible.

You can also use an [access token](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/). See the [`auth` Options docs](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options) for more information.

### Analytics Dashboard

The [AnalyticsDashboard](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AnalyticsDashboard) component handles loading the Google Analytics Embed API, sign-in and sign-out, and view selection for you. See the [full example](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AnalyticsDashboard#example).

The following example embeds an analytics dashboard with two charts.

Be sure to **change the [`authOptions`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options)** to use your [**clientId**](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/google-oauth-client-id) or [**serverAuth.access_token**](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/).

From there, you can experiment with [other drop-in charts](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/charts#common-charts) or [try creating your own](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/charts#custom-charts).

```jsx
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from "react-analytics-charts";
// Over ten different commonly used charts are available
import { SessionsByDateChart, SessionsGeoChart } from "react-analytics-charts";
```

```jsx
<AnalyticsDashboard
  authOptions={{
    clientId:
      "123456789012-abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  }}
  renderCharts={(gapi, viewId) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <SessionsByDateChart
          gapi={gapi}
          viewId={viewId}
          showPageViews
          showUsers
        />
        <SessionsGeoChart gapi={gapi} viewId={viewId} showPageViews />
        ... More charts here ...
      </div>
    );
  }}
/>
```

See the [Charts Overview](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/charts) for more charts, and [AnalyticsDashboard](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AnalyticsDashboard) for more information on the dashboard itself.

### Standalone Charts

All of the charts in this library can be used standalone.

If you have the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) (`gapi`) loaded and ready, and you know [which view ID](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/ViewSelector#example) to query, you can pick any of the [available charts](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/charts) and drop them right onto your site as [standalone charts](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/custom-dashboards-standalone-charts#standalone-charts).

For example, if your view ID is `ga:123456789`:

```jsx
import { SessionsByDateChart } from "react-analytics-charts";
```

```jsx
<SessionsByDateChart gapi={gapi} viewId="ga:123456789" />
```

You must be authorized. You can use the [ViewSelector example](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/ViewSelector#example) to determine your view ID, and the [useAnalyticsApi](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/useAnalyticsApi) hook to easily load the `gapi` API and authorize. If you use the [AnalyticsDashboard](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-analytics-charts/AnalyticsDashboard), this will all be handled for you.
