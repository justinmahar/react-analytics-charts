<h1>BounceRateChart</h1>

## Description

This [LineChart](/LineChart) charts the bounce rate percentage for each date, until today.

A "bounce" occurs when a visitor arrives at your site and promptly leaves without interacting any further.

The bounce rate is the percentage of users who bounce. A lower bounce rate indicates higher initial engagement. ⛹️‍♂️

Useful for seeing how well a site grabs people's attention and "hooks" them into staying.

Refer to the [Charts Overview](/charts) for a list of all charts available.

## Usage

<Playground>
  <AnalyticsDashboard
    authOptions={{ clientId }}
    renderCharts={(gapi, viewId) => {
      return <BounceRateChart gapi={gapi} viewId={viewId} days={28} />;
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| gapi | `GoogleAnalyticsEmbedAPI` | **Required.** The ready and authorized [Google Analytics Embed API](https://devboldly.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) |
| viewId | `string` | **Required.** View ID for the view the chart pertains to. See [ViewSelector](/ViewSelector) for more information. |
| days | `number` &#124; `undefined` | Optional. Number of days the chart shows data for. Defaults to `28`. |
| container | `string` &#124; `undefined` | Optional. HTML element ID for the container to which the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://devboldly.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) renders. One will be created if no value is provided. |
| options | [LineChartOptions](/LineChart#chart-options) | Optional. The options for this chart have been preconfigured, but you can add or override any [LineChartOptions](/LineChart#chart-options) you'd like here, such as the `width` or `title`. |
| query | [`Query`](/DataChart#query-prop) | Optional. The [query](/DataChart#query-prop) for this chart has been preconfigured, but you can override any [query properties](/DataChart#query-prop) you'd like here. |

This component also supports **all `div` props**, such as `className`, `style`, and `onClick`.

If you have more than one of this chart on the page, be sure to specify a unique `container` ID.

## Data Queried

This query's date range spans from a `start-date` of `NdaysAgo`, where `N` is the `days` prop provided, until an `end-date` of `today`. See [DataChart](/DataChart) for more information on queries.

### Metrics

- `ga:bounceRate`

### Dimensions

- `ga:date`

## Customizing

This chart has been preconfigured for ease of use, but you can customize it by providing a `query` or `options` prop.

The properties you specify in either prop object will override the ones used by this chart.

This means you can cherry-pick the properties you'd like to override, such as the `metrics` in the `query`, or the `width` in `options`, without having to create a completely [custom chart](/charts#custom-charts).
