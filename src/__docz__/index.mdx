## Overview

Easily embed Google Analytics charts on your React site using this component library, which leverages the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/).

Choose from [10+ commonly used drop-in chart components](/charts#common-charts), or build your own [custom charts](/charts#custom-charts) and render them as [bar charts](/BarChart), 
[column charts](/ColumnChart), [geo charts](/GeoChart), [line charts](/LineChart), [pie charts](/PieChart), and [tables](/TableChart).

See the [AnalyticsDashboard](/AnalyticsDashboard) documentation for a **[full live demo](/AnalyticsDashboard#example)**, or reference any of the available [charts](/charts) for individual live demo examples.

### Features include:

- **🙌 Simple and quick**
  - Drop Google Analytics [charts](/charts) onto your React site within minutes.
- **🎁 Pre-made drop-in charts**
  - Choose from [10+ pre-made commonly used charts](/charts) that you can use right away.
- **⚒️ Easy to build custom charts**
  - Building [your own charts](/charts) is easy, too!
- **💼 Handles overhead for you**
  - [Dashboard](/AnalyticsDashboard) handles embed API access, sign-in, sign-out, and view selection for you. Just focus on the [charts](/charts) you want.
- **✨ Live examples and rich documentation**
  - Quickly refer to docs on queries and charts, all from one place, with plenty of live examples.

## Installation

```
npm i react-analytics-charts
```

## Quick Start

First, you will need an [OAuth Client ID](/google-oauth-client-id) from Google to access the Analytics API. See [How To Get An OAuth Client ID From Google](/google-oauth-client-id) to make this as easy and painless as possible.

You can also use an [access token](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/). See the [`auth` Options docs](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options) for more information.

### Analytics Dashboard

The [AnalyticsDashboard](/AnalyticsDashboard) component handles loading the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/), sign-in and sign-out, and view selection for you. See the [live demo](/AnalyticsDashboard#example).

The following example embeds an analytics dashboard with two charts.

Be sure to **change the [`authOptions`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options)** to use your [**clientId**](/google-oauth-client-id) or [**serverAuth.access_token**](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/).

From there, you can experiment with [other drop-in charts](/charts#common-charts) or [try creating your own](/charts#custom-charts).

```jsx
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from 'react-analytics-charts';
// Over ten different commonly used charts are available
import { SessionsByDateChart, SessionsGeoChart } from 'react-analytics-charts';
```

```jsx
<AnalyticsDashboard
  authOptions={{ clientId: "123456789012-abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345p.apps.googleusercontent.com" }}
  renderCharts={(gapi, viewId) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <SessionsByDateChart
          gapi={gapi}
          viewId={viewId}
          showPageViews
          showUsers
        />
        <SessionsGeoChart 
          gapi={gapi} 
          viewId={viewId} 
          showPageViews 
        />
        ... More charts here ...
      </div>
    );
  }}
/>
```

See the [Charts Overview](/charts) for more charts, and [AnalyticsDashboard](/AnalyticsDashboard) for more information on the dashboard itself.

### Standalone Charts

All of the charts in this library can be used standalone.

If you have the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) (`gapi`) loaded and ready, and you know [which view ID](/ViewSelector#example) to query, you can pick any of the [available charts](/charts) and drop them right onto your site as [standalone charts](/custom-dashboards-standalone-charts#standalone-charts).

For example, if your view ID is `ga:123456789`:

```jsx
import { SessionsByDateChart } from 'react-analytics-charts';
```

```jsx
<SessionsByDateChart gapi={gapi} viewId="ga:123456789" />
```

You must be authorized. You can use the [ViewSelector demo](/ViewSelector#example) to determine your view ID, and the [useAnalyticsApi](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/useAnalyticsApi) hook to easily load the `gapi` API and authorize. If you use the [AnalyticsDashboard](/AnalyticsDashboard), this will all be handled for you.
